Commands you can execute inside the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) `app` directory

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `yarn install` | Install project dependencies |
| `yarn build` | Builds code bundle with production settings  |

## Prerequisites

Before you build and run, you'll need to [install the Ultralight prerequisites](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/installing-prerequisites) for your platform.

You also need to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to work with React
## Development

### React

Inside the `app` folder resides React, you need to install dependencies by executing the following commands

```shell
yarn
```

Before anything else you need to build the react project. You need to do this everytime you want to test the desktop application.

```shell
yarn build
```

### Ultralight

Setup the Ultralight build folder, you only have to do this once by executing the following commands

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Once the above is setup everytime you need to rebuild the application you need to execute the following on the `build` directory

```shell
cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
```

> Note you may need to delete the binary eg. `MyApp` in this case.


## Running

#### On macOS and Linux

Navigate to `ultralight-quick-start/build` and run `MyApp` to launch the program.

#### On Windows
